# Ranges   : sequence or series

# use of ranges :
#       as Sequences
#       as Conditions
#       as Intervals


# Sequences   :ranges express a sequence. start point, an end point

puts "#{(range_1).to_a}"   # to_a  : ype conversion to array

puts "#{(range_2).to_a}"   

# Ranges implement methods that let you iterate over them and test their contents in a variety of ways âˆ’
